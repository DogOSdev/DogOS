## What is DogOS?

DogOS will be a fully-featured operating system made in Cosmos(OS) and .NET 2.0 C#. It is in heavy development right now, and there is barely anything added so far. Star the repository to get updates on development, or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3N2HPf4bZe) server.

## Features

DogOS currently features the following:
- GUI with a Widget system and Window system.

Check the repositories [Project's](https://github.com/DogOSdev/DogOS/projects) tab to check what needs to be done.

## Screenshots

> Alright that's all cool, but what about some awesome screenshots?

Right now DogOS is in a very *early* development stage, so there isn't really anything to show yet.

This section will be updated when there's more things added.
