## What is DogOS?

DogOS will be a fully-featured operating system made in Cosmos(OS) and .NET 2.0 C#. It is in heavy development right now, and there is barely anything added so far. Star the repository to get updates on development, or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3N2HPf4bZe) server.

## Features

DogOS currently features the following:
- GUI with a Widget system and Window system.

Check the repositories [Project's](https://github.com/DogOSdev/DogOS/projects) tab to check what needs to be done.

## Screenshots

> Alright that's all cool, but what about some awesome screenshots?

Right now DogOS is in a very *early* development stage, so there isn't really anything to show yet.

This section will be updated when there's more things added.

## Building

You can build DogOS on your own, and help development if you want. There are multiple steps to building.

1. Install the COSMOS Dev Kit. The instructions are [here](https://www.gocosmos.org/docs/install/).
1. Once installed, clone the repository and open the project in Visual Studio 2019.
1. If needed, open the project's Properties and change the profile. If you are using VMware, make sure to change the edition to your edition. It is currently at Workstation.
1. Run the project, and it should open and boot!
